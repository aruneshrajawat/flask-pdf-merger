#Flask PDF Merger is a simple web application built with Python and Flask that allows users to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF. To use it, start the server with python run.py or python start_server.py, open your browser at http://localhost:5000, upload the PDF files, click Merge, and download the merged PDF. Uploaded PDFs are saved in the uploads/ folder and merged PDFs in the output/ folder, which are ignored in Git along with venv/ and __pycache__/. This project is lightweight, easy to use, and comes with all the necessary frontend and backend files for quick deployment.
